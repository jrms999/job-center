Papers Please - Job Center edition


About

Job Center is a satrical take on the game "Papers Please" where instead of taking on the role of a border crossing immigration officer in the fictional dystopian Eastern Bloc-like country of Arstotzka in the year 1982, you are Frank, a job center officer. The player must review each job center claiment and either passing them or denying their claim. Be warned, your actions and decisions have a direct effect on the wellbeing of the claiments - to their deaths.
